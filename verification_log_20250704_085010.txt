But if West holds the diamond ace\u2014 marking East with the trump ace (because of West's failure to open the bidding)\u2014declarer should play trumps by leading first to the king and, if that holds, ducking the next round (unless West plays the jack). South must assume trumps are 3-2. If East is known to hold the ace, playing to the queen and ten will win if East holds A-J, A-J-9, A-J-8, A-J-7 (four cases).

But South may want to lead towards dummy's queen of diamonds, rather than lead the queen itself (in case West has A x). When the complete count becomes available, and West is known to hold a doubleton diamond, the best play in diamonds is to lead low to the queen, and, if East wins and returns a diamond, to duck it to dummy's ten. This wins in 16 cases out of a possible 21 (West has AJ, Ax, or xx) whereas leading the king wins in only 6 cases out of 21 (West has AJ or Jx). Note that on a double-dummy basis the contract is defeated by a diamond lead, which prevents declarer from developing the end-position.",

In either of the above attempts, South may be forced to depend on making a quick spade trick, and may be defeated if he misguesses spades or if West has both honors. If instead, however, South sets out immediately to establish a spade trick\u2014by leading the spade king from his hand at the second trick\u2014only a highly adverse distribution of the unseen cards can defeat him. If, for example, East-West win and lead another trump, declarer can knock out the remaining spade honor, with both a trump in dummy and the heart ace available to stop the heart suit.",

Declarer is sure to pick up the club suit even if one opponent has all four missing clubs\u2014if he leads the king or queen first. But in diamonds, if the suit is 4-0 declarer must guess how to play the suit\u2014king or queen first if he judges East may have all four; ace first, if he judges West may hold all four. Declarer should reserve his decision in diamonds as long as possible to get information to help him resolve this guess. After playing clubs and discovering West has all four, it cannot hurt him to play off his major-suit winners. In the course of doing this, he discovers, with the cards as in the diagram, that East started with eight hearts and at least two spades, so it is impossible for him to have started with four diamonds. So, declarer should cash the diamond ace first. An optimal play sequence would be: spade ace, club king, heart king, club finesse, heart ace, spade king, diamond ace, diamond finesse, club queen, clubs in the South hand, diamond.",

If either opponent is void of clubs it is surely West (who has four hearts, presumably four or more spades, and at least two diamonds). Therefore South should play the six of hearts, win as cheaply as possible in dummy, and lead spades through East. If East takes the ace of spades and gives West a club ruff, the contract is still safe because declarer now has two spade tricks. If South is allowed to win the king of spades, he can draw the last trump and proceed to tackle clubs. And if West holds the ace of spades, there is no danger to the contract in any event.",
