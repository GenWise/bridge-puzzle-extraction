If clubs are not favorably split, South will need \nfour diamond tricks and can attack that suit. \nIn order to provide for the contingency that he will \nneed to attack diamonds, South should cash the ace of \ndiamonds at trick two. This is a safety play that gives him \nthe maximum chance to get four diamond tricks. It is \nessential to make this play at once, because there may be \nno further chance to reenter dummy after clubs are \ntested. \nCashing the ace of diamonds at trick two reduces \nSouth’s chances of making five diamond tricks, but five \ndiamond tricks will never be essential to the contract. \n44"
