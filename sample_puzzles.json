The critical fact is that the club and diamond suits have different properties. Declarer is sure to pick up the club suit even if one opponent has all four missing clubs—if he leads the king or queen first. But in diamonds, if the suit is 4-0 declarer must guess how to play the suit—king or queen first if he judges East may have all four; ace first, if he judges West may hold all four. Declarer should reserve his decision in diamonds as long as possible to get information to help him resolve this guess. After playing clubs and discovering West has all four, it cannot hurt him to play off his major-suit winners. In the course of doing this, he discovers, with the cards as in the diagram, that East started with eight hearts and at least two spades, so it is impossible for him to have started with four diamonds.

However, one West leads the heart queen, and can therefore be presumed to hold the heart jack (and very likely the ten and/or nine as well), the percentage play in spades (by a very narrow margin) is to cash the king and finesse East for the spade queen. All this, however, has nothing to do with how to play this hand. Regardless of how declarer intends to play against a normal break, he should take precautions against a 4-0 split by winning the first trick in his hand with the heart ace and cashing the ace of clubs. Now a spade to the king and, if spades are not 4-0, declarer must guess the spades to bring in the contract. But if spades are 4-0, declarer can try for an end-play as follows: club ruff (not a spade finesse, even if West showed out), diamond ace-king, heart king, club ruff, heart ruff, club ruff, diamond. If all has gone well, an opponent will be down to three trumps for his last three cards, and South will score the spade ace-jack at the end.
