      "solutionExplanation": "South seems to have nine easy tricks, but there is a fly in the ointment: the club suit is blocked. The block will not prevent running the suit if the opponents' clubs are split 2-1. In that case, declarer can win the first two club tricks with the king and queen, exhausting the East-West clubs, then win the third trick in clubs with the nine, and finally overtake the eight with the ace. However, a 3-0 club split will doom this plan, and declarer should take measures to guard against this possibility. The simplest way to overcome the problem is to discard one of South's clubs. This can be accomplished only through one suit, spades, so South should duck the opening lead. If West leads another spade, declarer ducks again and can now take nine tricks by playing king-queen-ace of clubs and throwing his last club on the spade ace. If West shifts, declarer wins and ducks another spade himself, achieving the same position.",

The defenders can win this trick, but declarer will take the rest (barring a 5-0 break in a black suit). A further heart lead can be ruffed in dummy. This play gives up an overtrick when trumps break 3-2, but preserves the contract when trumps break 4-1. If declarer tries to draw trumps by leading high ones, a 4-1 trump break defeats him. If South tries to ruff two hearts and throw another on a club, he may be frustrated by a 4-1 club break. The immediate duck in spades avoids all these dangers.",

      "solutionExplanation": "This contract looks easy, but is actually tricky. The critical fact is that the club and diamond suits have different properties. Declarer is sure to pick up the club suit even if one opponent has all four missing clubs—if he leads the king or queen first. But in diamonds, if the suit is 4-0 declarer must guess how to play the suit—king or queen first if he judges East may have all four; ace first, if he judges West may hold all four. Declarer should reserve his decision in diamonds as long as possible to get information to help him resolve this guess. After playing clubs and discovering West has all four, it cannot hurt him to play off his major-suit winners. In the course of doing this, he discovers, with the cards as in the diagram, that East started with eight hearts and at least two spades, so it is impossible for him to have started with four diamonds. So, declarer should cash the diamond ace first. An optimal play sequence would be: spade ace, club king, heart king, club finesse, heart ace, spade king, diamond ace, diamond finesse, club queen, clubs in the South hand, diamond.",

Even though trumps are 3-1, there will be no problem if a high heart is not ruffed, since dummy's ruffing trump is a high one. When declarer draws a second round of trumps and discovers that East holds the missing trump, he should play to neutralize the effect of the ruff of a high heart. The correct play is to draw two trumps, then cash one high heart, then lead a diamond to dummy in order to lead a heart through East. If East ruffs, declarer follows low, and later ruffs his remaining low heart in dummy. If East discards, declarer safely wins his second high heart and ruffs a heart loser in dummy. Not taking a second round of trumps would be the best play for seven, not six.",

After winning the heart ace—there is no point to a hold-up—declarer should realize that the defense can take six tricks if they are allowed in at once with the ace of trumps.

If East has four clubs and wins the first club, declarer ducks the second round (after unblocking in spades if necessary) and makes nine tricks. If East has four clubs and ducks the first club, South switches to diamonds. If the defense wins this, they cannot prevent South from unblocking in spades and scoring nine tricks. If the defense ducks one diamond (to cut declarer's transportation), South returns to clubs. If East ducks the second club, South goes back to diamonds for at least nine tricks. If East wins the second club, he must return a spade (to prevent the establishment of clubs) and South now reverts to diamonds. Another line is slightly superior in that it gives better chances for an overtrick while still assuring the contract, and is thus the best play at either form of bridge. Declarer",

So South should win the opening lead, cash his high diamonds, and crossruff the balance with high trumps. Note how the play would go in the absence of taking the high diamonds early: club ten, heart ace, heart ruff, spade ace-king throwing a diamond, spade ruff, heart ruff, spade ruff, heart ruff on which East throws a diamond.

      "solutionExplanation": "Even if the diamond suit can be brought in, South is in danger of losing two spade tricks. If trumps are 2-2, all is well. But if trumps are 3-1, he must ruff a spade in the closed hand after taking a discard in clubs. This play will succeed if one defender (almost certainly East) holds three diamonds and four clubs. To give himself the best opportunity to overcome a 3-1 trump split, South should duck the first spade. Upon winning the spade return he can take two rounds of trumps, then play on clubs (discarding a spade), ruff a spade, and finally return to dummy to draw the remaining trump. If South wins the first spade, he must give up a spade trick before ruffing a spade. If he has drawn two rounds of trumps, East will win the spade and lead a third round, killing the ruff. Attempting to circumvent this by drawing only one trump will lose the contract if West, with queen doubleton of diamonds and two clubs, has the acumen to put up the queen of diamonds on the first trump lead — not a difficult play.",

But the defenders may get to their diamond trick first. To minimize this danger, declarer should plan to refuse the club finesse. Taking the club finesse will lose the contract if East holds the queen of clubs and the defender with the long trump holds fewer than three clubs. If, however, declarer plays ace, king, and another club (before the ace of diamonds is removed) he is assured a chance to discard on the fourth club. This line of play will insure the contract if clubs are four-two or better, or the club queen is singleton (unless West holds all five trumps). But it can be improved still further. Declarer should take the ace of hearts and lead a club to the ace at once. Then he draws three rounds of trumps and leads a second club. If West started with four trumps and a singleton club he cannot profitably ruff, and declarer still gets a chance to discard on the fourth club. Leading a club to the ace at the second trick has nothing to lose, for the contract is safe if either opponent ruffs.",

Thus, the spade ace must be dislodged before trumps are drawn. If declarer knocks out the ace of spades before drawing trumps, the only danger to the contract is a club ruff. If either opponent is void of clubs it is surely West (who has four hearts, presumably four or more spades, and at least two diamonds). Therefore South should play the six of hearts, win as cheaply as possible in dummy, and lead spades through East. If East takes the ace of spades and gives West a club ruff, the contract is still safe because declarer now has two spade tricks. If South is allowed to win the king of spades, he can draw the last trump and proceed to tackle clubs. And if West holds the ace of spades, there is no danger to the contract in any event.",

Therefore, declarer should plan to succeed whenever possible if diamonds break 4-2. In this event two ruffs will be required to establish a long diamond in dummy and a spade ruff is also necessary (for the thirteenth trick). So the basic plan must be: win the club king (retaining the club ace as a late entry to cash the long diamond), take the ace-king of diamonds, ruff a diamond, ruff a spade, ruff a diamond, draw trumps, lead a club to the ace, and cash the good diamond in dummy. As a safety play, declarer should cash the king and ace of hearts before attacking diamonds. This will avoid an overruff if West holds doubletons in both red suits, and an uppercut if (as in the diagram) East holds two doubletons. This line also succeeds if East has three hearts and two diamonds.",

      "solutionExplanation": "If spades do not split 3-3, declarer will require a spade ruff in dummy for his tenth trick. Although the unfavorable trump lead puts the defense one step ahead in the race, declarer should play spades at once in the hope the defender with four spades has only two trumps (and thus cannot play a third round of trumps when he wins the third round of spades). There is the additional possibility that hearts are 4-1 and the defender with the singleton heart can be forced to win one of the defensive spade tricks. Accordingly, declarer should win the first trick in the closed hand and finesse the spade ten. With cards as shown, West cannot win both spade tricks—but he can if declarer plays ace and another space. The only danger in this line is that spades break 5-1. This is highly unlikely in view of the absence of a spade overcall.",

In any event, declarer will take 12 tricks. Leading the king of diamonds first is likely to prove superior only if West holds all four missing diamonds. However, the chances of making the contract in that situation are not bright, even if South starts with the king of diamonds.

By starting hearts, South wins if one of two finesses in hearts succeeds or if either opponent holds the singleton king of diamonds. Starting diamonds also gives declarer the chance to win one of two finesses, but with an important difference. If the first diamond play is from dummy, South can finesse against either the king or jack of diamonds in the East hand. Assuming the finesse loses, declarer can then try to drop the remaining diamond honor doubleton before reverting to the heart finesse. Since a particular diamond honor singleton or doubleton is a better chance than the king singleton, starting diamonds from dummy gives declarer a better chance than starting hearts. There is also the additional chance that East will go up with the king of diamonds if he has it (so declarer should probably finesse against the jack of diamonds when he leads from dummy). Note that it would be wrong to lead diamonds first from the South hand, for a losing diamond finesse and a heart return will force declarer to commit himself prematurely.",

Clubs is the superior throw-in suit (because the defense is less likely to be able to unblock), so declarer should hope for unbalanced diamonds. The basic plan, therefore is to strip the majors, duck one diamond, then take the minor-suit tops and lead a third club. Declarer must be careful, however, to win the first spade. He has nothing to lose by this—after drawing three trumps he plays back spades and proceeds as before. If the first spade is ducked, East may shift to a diamond.

(If trumps split 5-0, there is little point playing on clubs.) If both opponents follow, declarer should play the ace and king of clubs, then ruff a club. If clubs split 4-3, declarer ruffs a spade, ruffs a club, and claims his slam, using the ace of diamonds as entry to the long club. If clubs split 5-2, declarer gives up on clubs, draws trumps, and ducks a diamond. This will bring in the contract if diamonds are 2-2 or if a squeeze can be developed. The trap to avoid is ruffing a club before cashing the second honor in dummy. This gains only if clubs break 6-1 (and then probably only if West has the singleton) and loses in a fairly normal distribution of the cards such as the one shown. By playing correctly, declarer sees the club break in time to give up on clubs and play diamonds. If the key play is not made, and a second club is ruffed, declarer loses control and cannot take advantage of the 2-2 diamond break.",

      "solutionExplanation": "After discarding two heart losers on the top spades, South must decide how to handle his diamonds. The surest shot is to plan to ruff the fourth diamond in dummy, so declarer plans to cash two diamonds and lead a third round, ruffing the fourth diamond in dummy if the suit does not divide well. To avoid having his diamond honors ruffed if East is short in diamonds, South should lead towards them twice—the first time immediately after winning his two spades. Now South plans to use the club ace as the entry to lead towards his second diamond honor, but should lead his remaining heart first. If he fails to do this, East may ruff the second diamond and put West in with a heart to get a second diamond ruff. After giving up his heart, South wins the return, leads a trump to dummy, leads up to his second diamond honor, and continues with his plan to ruff the fourth diamond.",

If West has the queen of hearts he can win and return a heart, but declarer can use same throw in as in the previous problem. If East has the queen of hearts and covers, South wins and leads a heart towards dummy. If West plays the highest outstanding heart, declarer ducks and the play proceeds as before. Otherwise declarer wins in dummy, ruffs a diamond, leads a trump to dummy, and plays the queen of diamonds, discarding his last heart. If West started with no more than two hearts, he is endplayed. If West leads a heart and East does not beat it, South throws a club and West cannot escape. Thus, if West started with ♥ 10 9 8, ♥ 10 9 8 7, or five or more hearts, the contract will still come home. Furthermore, if West holds ♥ 10 9 x (as in the diagram), he still cannot escape the end-play, even if he unblocks on the first round. And, of course, there are many Wests who would fail to unblock from an original holding of ♥ 10 x x. Finally, there is always the club finesse if all else fails.",

      "solutionExplanation": "South should be in his own hand after taking his black-suit tricks. In an elimination position it is as effective to lead the diamond king as to lead up to it. But South may want to lead towards dummy's queen of diamonds, rather than lead the queen itself (in case West has A x). When the complete count becomes available, and West is known to hold a doubleton diamond, the best play in diamonds is to lead low to the queen, and, if East wins and returns a diamond, to duck it to dummy's ten. This wins in 16 cases out of a possible 21 (West has AJ, Ax, or xx) whereas leading the king wins in only 6 cases out of 21 (West has AJ or Jx). Note that on a double-dummy basis the contract is defeated by a diamond lead, which prevents declarer from developing the end-position.",

If the ten of hearts is not established, dummy can be entered with a third round of trumps in order to ruff the last heart. (If trumps were 2-0, South would cash the heart ace-king before taking the second trump.) South now leads to the queen of diamonds. If West has the diamond king (so that the diamond finesse would have won), he is end-played. If East has the diamond king, declarer must fall back on the club finesse.",

If trumps break 1-1, however, declarer can avoid the risk of the diamond finesse when West has a singleton club honor. He should ruff a heart high, lead the six of spades to the seven, ruff dummy's last heart high, and lead the four of spades to the five. Now a low club to the ten will endplay West if, as in the diagram, he began with a singleton club honor. If West can exit with a club, declarer picks up the clubs and later tries the diamond finesse.

Nonetheless, the contract is guaranteed. South first cashes the heart king. East must follow, else West has 14 cards. If West shows out, South takes the heart jack, spade king, two hearts, then draws trumps. If West follows to the heart king, East must hold at least one club, so South cashes the club ace without risk. If West shows out (see diagram), declarer ruffs a club high in dummy, finesses the spade eight and claims. If West follows to the club ace, it must be safe for South to cash the heart jack. If West shows out, South proceeds as before. If West follows to the heart jack, the second club must go through. Now, a club is ruffed with the king of spades, and declarer draws trumps and claims.",

The correct play, therefore, is first to lead the spade king from the South hand. Even if East holds both majors, the contract is probably home (club ace, spade king, diamond ace, spade ace, diamond ruff, club, spade, and East is end-played). If South plays the spade ace first, he is doomed if West holds both majors. West can afford to lead a heart from J 10 9 5; East can't.",

If the diamond queen holds, South plays a low diamond next. If the diamond queen is captured by East, South ducks the diamond return; if West takes the diamond queen and leads low, dummy plays the nine. At matchpoints, South cannot afford the luxury of the safety play. He needs the overtrick (easy to get if East has A x, A x x, or J 10 of diamonds) to beat pairs in three no-trump and five diamonds. So dummy's two club entries should be used to lead twice towards the king-queen of diamonds. South needn't worry about the pairs in six clubs—they will presumably go down two if he goes down one.",

      "solutionExplanation": "If South is to avoid the club finesse, he will probably need to find one opponent with the singleton or doubleton ace of spades. The information content of the opening lead is neutral (West holds the ten and nine of hearts, East the queen and jack), so South should make his choice depending on the distribution of the trumps. If East is (relatively) long in trumps, declarer should play him for short spades by leading a spade to his king and ducking a spade on the way back. If West is long in trumps, as in the diagram, South should start spades by leading low from his hand towards dummy's queen. If this holds, he should cash off the other heart and lead to the spade king, endplaying West if that defender started with the doubleton ace of spades. There is one other possibility, however. By leading a spade to the king and a spade back after eliminating hearts and diamonds, declarer triumphs if West started with any of these spade holdings: A, 10-9, or 10-x where he fails to unblock, in addition to five spades without the ace. We leave to arithmeticians the problem of whether this does or does not overcome the distributional inference of West holding two out of the three trumps. We think not.",

      "solutionExplanation": "At rubber bridge, South should finesse spades back the other way! This guards against a clever hold-up by a West with four spades to the queen and short diamonds, and loses only if the opponents can obtain a red-suit ruff. At matchpoints, South cannot afford this safety play. The contract is fairly normal and an overtrick seems likely. If West has made the hold-up play, he deserves to collect. In any event, declarer is not necessarily down after leading a spade to the king—West may have three or more diamonds. An alternative matchpoint maneuver would be to lead a diamond to dummy and a spade, intending to finesse the ten. This risks probably unnecessary complications, however, if diamonds break 5-1.",

If West captures the seven, South can later draw trumps, ruff a spade in dummy, and play three rounds of hearts, end-playing the defense. In other words, South should not let his partner's failure to bid six diamonds stop him from making the best play for five. Is this a safety play against only a 1-in-20 chance? (The chance of a 4-0 break is roughly 10%, so East will have all four trumps only about 5% of the time.) No, the danger is as great as 1-in-10. Assuming East would play the diamond six whenever he held it, half the originally possible diamond combinations (those in which West holds the six) become impossible, so the chance of East holding all four diamonds is roughly 5% out of 50%, or 1-in-10.",

Thus, there will be time to duck a spade and try for 3-2 or 4-1 spades, or the heart ten dropping, or the club ace onside. If the heart queen holds, declarer can duck a spade and retain similar chances. Other plays do not cover so many possible lies of the opponents' cards. If, for example, declarer plays ace and queen of hearts, West may win and lead a third round of the suit. If this sets up a second defensive heart trick, declarer will have to guess whether to play on spades or clubs. Alternatively, if a spade is ducked at once, the clever defense of an immediate spade return will give declarer serious entry problems, and once again he may be at the mercy of the club position.",

With the spade eight demoted to a seven, the end-play in spades may not succeed: East can use intermediate spades to prevent South from duck-ing the lead to West. However, the corresponding promotion of the club seven to the eight gives South a sure thing with a different line of play. He should win the opening lead, cash the club ace, reenter his hand with a heart ruff, and lead the club eight. If West shows out (as in the diagram), the club eight can be ducked to East. Later, declarer uses his two trump entries to dummy to take a ruffing finesse against East's club queen, and chases two club winners for spade discards. If West follows to the club eight, declarer finesses the club jack. If East wins, one club ruff will establish the suit for two discards.",

This sets the defense a problem it cannot resolve. A diamond lead will still solve that suit, and a heart lead from West will establish a discard. The only chance for the defense, therefore, is for East to win the second club and lead a heart—but declarer counters this by discarding a diamond.

If declarer must lose a club trick and he judges the clubs and long spade are together, he should finesse the other opponent for the jack of hearts, but if he judges that (say) West holds the long spade and East shows up with the clubs, he should lead a heart to his king, and play on clubs if this holds.

This requires three club ruffs in dummy as well, so the heart ace must be the entry to the diamonds. Thus, the correct line is: spade nine, club ruff, heart king, club ruff, diamond ace, diamond ruff, draw trumps. If the diamond honors have dropped and the suit was 4-3, dummy is now high.

If West keeps two hearts, declarer overtakes the spade queen, ruffs a club, and takes the rest in dummy.

All this, however, has nothing to do with how to play this hand. Regardless of how declarer intends to play against a normal break, he should take precautions against a 4-0 split by winning the first trick in his hand with the heart ace and cashing the ace of clubs. Now a spade to the king and, if spades are not 4-0, declarer must guess the spades to bring in the contract. But if spades are 4-0, declarer can try for an end-play as follows: club ruff (not a spade finesse, even if West showed out), diamond ace-king, heart king, club ruff, heart ruff, club ruff, diamond. If all has gone well, an opponent will be down to three trumps for his last three cards, and South will score the spade ace-jack at the end.

If trumps break 4-0, declarer has no choice but to draw trumps, run the rest of his trumps, and hope for the best. Assuming trumps do not break 4-0, South faces a close percentage question. With a 4-0 trump break eliminated, the chance of a 2-2 trump split is 45%. (The chances of 3-1 and 2-2 trump splits, originally roughly 49.7% and 40.7% respectively, maintain the same ratio but now must add to 100%, thus becoming 55% and 45% respectively.) So, by playing ace and a low spade, ruffing in his hand, then leading a heart to dummy, declarer makes whenever spades are 3-3 or 4-2 (about 84%) and trumps are 2-2 (about 45%); almost 38% of the time. The alternative play, running all the trumps, makes the contract whenever spades are 3-3 (about 36%), or if the opponents make a mistake in the ending. Against strong opposition, therefore, playing for trumps to be 2-2 is probably the best play. In any event, the two lines of play are virtually equivalent in merit.",

(And, for you squeeze experts, if West holds the spades and one diamond honor there is a double guard squeeze. It is true that declarer may misguess the diamond position in the ending, but the club nine in the closed hand limits the false-carding opportunities of the defense; the declarer should guess right most of the time even against expert opponents.)",

Against perfect defense, the only chances are (1) singleton ace of spades with West; (2) singleton ace of spades (and no chances to discard it) with East; (3) queen-jack doubleton of spades (and no chance to discard one) with East. The best you can do against perfect defense is combine (1) and (3): draw trumps, eliminate the minors, and lead a spade to the king. Against weak defenders there are some further chances. For example if West has the spade ace doubleton he may duck it. In order to induce this, declarer might want to lead the spade ten from his hand, either before or after the elimination. The value of leading the ten is that it may appear to West as if South is about to take a finesse against the queen. Perhaps, therefore, the best time to try this deception is after drawing trumps, but before eliminating the minors. (It would be unnatural for declarer to start spades before drawing trumps, and this may alert the West player.) This play gives up chances (1) and (3). A compromise is to lead the spade ten after the elimination. This gives up chance (3), but not chance (1). A poor defender may fail to count the hand, and play South for four spades.",

If clubs are 4-2 and the queen is not ruffed, ruff a club, reenter dummy with a trump, cash the long club, and play East for the heart ace. Plan Three lands the contract if clubs are 3-3 (36%) and if clubs are 4-2 (48%) provided East has the heart ace and the long trump is with the long clubs. The chance of the long trump and long clubs being together is somewhat less than 50%, so declarer wins out slightly less than 25% of the times that the clubs break 4-2 (actually, about 22.5% of the time). Nonetheless, the additional 11% that declarer gains from the 4-2 club splits (.225 times .48) makes Plan Three the best.",

      "solutionExplanation": "Declarer has a choice of two direct and one indirect line of play. The two direct lines are: (1) Win the club king, play finesse the queen of diamonds; (2) Win the club king, play ace and queen of diamonds. Between these, play (1) gives up a necessary entry to dummy. Plan (2), which succeeds if there is a singleton diamond honor or a doubleton jack, has roughly a one-third chance of success. The indirect play is superior to both. Declarer should win the club king in the closed hand and lead a spade. Then: (i) If West plays the spade ace, the contract can be brought home if spades are 3-3 or 4-2, or if the diamond finesse wins. (ii) If East tops the spade king with the ace, declarer will need a 3-3 spade split. (iii) If the spade king wins, declarer can take the diamond finesse. If this loses, declarer retains the chance of a doubleton diamond jack. If the diamond finesse wins, declarer can try to set up diamonds, and has chances even if this proves impossible. The indirect play is never worse than 36% (actually it's about 50% and is thus superior to either of the direct plans).",

      "solutionExplanation": "Unless spades are 2-2 and hearts 3-3, declarer will need to establish a club trick (through a double ruffing finesse, West holding both ace and queen) for his contract. In order to give himself the best chance of setting up this trick, he should begin by playing king, ace and a third heart, ruffing high. If hearts break 4-2, declarer starts clubs at once, leading the king and letting it ride if not covered. If hearts break 3-3, declarer plays one round of trumps. If trumps are 4-0, he begins clubs. If not, he leads the club king from his hand, tempting West to cover. If West ducks, declarer should ruff in dummy—hoping for a 2-2 trump split, which is more likely than finding West with both club honors. However, by leading the club king, South has a chance to play on clubs if spades are not 2-2: West may err in covering the club king. Note that it would do no good for South to draw a second trump, as he would then lack the entries to set up a club trick.",

He could ruff a heart in dummy immediately but the opponents will almost surely lead another trump before South can return to his hand for a second heart ruff. Alternatively, South could attempt to establish dummy's club suit. This, however, depends on a very favorable lie of the enemy clubs—and even if South is lucky he will not be sure how to proceed if the first club holds in dummy. In either of the above attempts, South may be forced to depend on making a quick spade trick, and may be defeated if he misguesses spades or if West has both honors. If instead, however, South sets out immediately to establish a spade trick—by leading the spade king from his hand at the second trick—only a highly adverse distribution of the unseen cards can defeat him. If, for example, East-West win and lead another trump, declarer can knock out the remaining spade honor, with both a trump in dummy and the heart ace available to stop the heart suit.",

And even in this instance, declarer can still recover with a successful club finesse.\n\nEven though you would choose Plan One if you knew the trumps were splitting 2-2, Plan Two is the best overall approach. The probability of finding East with a \"killing\" diamond holding is very low (less than 5%), and there is still the club finesse in reserve. Two losing finesses with a 3-1 trump break is a greater risk.",

If East proves to have a heart stopper, declarer can cash his other high spade and run diamonds, applying a double squeeze. (West must hold a high spade, East a high heart—South discards his own last heart if East keeps his guard in that suit on the last diamond—so neither can hold two clubs; and South wins the last trick with the club queen.) If it turns out that West has a heart stopper, that player must have four spades, four hearts, five diamonds, and therefore no clubs.

If West has the heart king the contract is assured: if West plays the king South has the rest; if West ducks, South can try the spade finesse for an overtrick. If East captures the heart jack with the king, declarer has time to test the hearts before going after spades. This gives him the opportunity to try to drop the doubleton or tripleton 10-9 of hearts. The best play, however, is to cash some of the minor-suit winners (being careful, of course, to leave enough entries to both hands) before adopting the basic line of play given above.

      "solutionExplanation": "If you planned to discard a high heart on the opening lead, you had the right idea. After this play declarer can draw two trumps, cash off the two remaining high hearts, then lead a third trump to dummy to run the rest of the heart suit. (It is more risky to try this without throwing away one high heart, for then declarer would have to try three rounds of hearts before drawing the third trump. This would make a defensive ruff more likely, leaving declarer to depend on the diamond finesse.) As is often the case, however, there is no need to put this plan, good though it may be, into operation at once. The correct play is to trump the first trick high, then lead a trump to dummy. If both opponents follow, South should lead dummy's remaining club and discard a high heart, continuing as described above. The advantage of the delaying maneuver is that declarer gets to test the trumps before committing himself. If trumps are 4-0, the heart discard plan will not work. Seeing the bad split, however, declarer can shift gears: he takes the diamond finesse and tries to ruff his long diamond in dummy.",

Down one. Of course, declarer cannot afford to duck the second diamond, but the contract should have been brought home anyway. The correct play is to ruff the first trick in the closed hand, draw trumps, then play hearts. As hearts are 3-3 this establishes two entryless winners in dummy. When the queen of diamonds loses to a doubleton king in the East hand, East will be end-played.

If the diamond king is used early, a defender with three trumps, three spades, and two clubs can discard a club on the fourth round of spades and prevent declarer from getting to dummy to draw the last trump.

If this gets through he should try for a complete cross-ruff (hoping to make nine spade tricks and three aces). West must be kept off lead, to avoid the killing lead of another trump, so South should play the ace of diamonds and ace and queen of hearts. If West does not cover, declarer throws dummy's diamond and takes the rest on a cross-ruff. If West covers the heart queen, declarer ruffs, returns to his hand with a high club ruff, and leads the ten of hearts, throwing dummy's diamond. This plan fails if West has a singleton or void in clubs, or a diamond void, or both heart honors (thus, it has about a 70% chance). This is superior to taking the heart finesse, even though the latter is a bit better than 50% (because of the known spade split). If the heart finesse loses and West returns a trump, declarer lacks the entries to establish and cash a club trick even if the suit breaks 4-3.",

      "solutionExplanation": "South should win the opening lead, and lead the club queen. The club play is unlikely to be relevant unless the suit breaks 4-0. (If clubs are 3-1 or 2-2 and the defense cannot or does not hold up, South has an easy 10 tricks. If there is a successful hold-up, South takes two clubs tricks and switches to diamonds, again scoring 10 tricks.) If this is in fact the club division, by leading the queen of clubs at trick two declarer forces the defense to withhold the club ace—if they take it, South next ducks a club and takes nine tricks. With one club trick in the bag, South switches to diamonds in time to score three spades, two hearts, three diamonds and one club. Note that if declarer begins clubs by leading to an honor in dummy, the contract can be defeated if East holds all four clubs. He need not duck the first club—declarer cannot possibly bring in the suit—and therefore wins and returns a spade (or heart). The defense still has two diamond entries and can establish and run a major suit. There is no reason to alter this sure-trick line of play at matchpoints.",

Still, South must take his best shot. The basic line is to draw trumps, cash the hearts and clubs ending in dummy, and lead a diamond. If East holds (a), the doubleton ace-queen of diamonds, or (b), the singleton ace of diamonds, the hand plays itself. If East plays a low diamond, South can play the jack (hoping that West holds (c), the singleton ace), or the king (hoping that West holds (d), the doubleton queen-ten). The latter play is superior not only in that holding (d) is slightly more likely than holding (c), but because West may fail to unblock with (e), some other doubleton-queen holding, or East may duck with ace doubleton. These chances are all slight. Declarer can almost cer-",
